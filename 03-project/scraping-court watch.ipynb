The rules I see most frequently enforced include no cell phone use, no talking on the benches, and for the accused, no turning around to look at family. These rules may seem simple enough  to follow and enforce, but in my time with court watch, I’ve seen how these simples rules do not account for the needs and understandable instincts of the accused and their families, and can be enforced in unnecessarily aggressive and adversarial ways.\n",

      "                For example, I usually court watch during the night shift, 6-9 PM in Brooklyn, and there are often families sitting on the benches next to me — mothers with young children who wait sometimes hours for their loved ones to appear before the judge. The room is nearly always over-air conditioned and the children get antsy and cold and distracted. Yet, their presence in the room will become crucial when their loved one’s defense points to them during the arraignment and says, “he has ties to the community. In fact, his family is here tonight.” Oftentimes while the adults in the families are waiting for this moment to come, they’re managing a difficult situation — they don’t know when their loved one will appear; the kids get tired and hungry; the stress of not knowing what will happen to the accused is of course enormous (I’ve seen families cry with relief at RORs); perhaps they’ve taken time off of work to attend the arraignment and they’re trying to negotiate how much longer they can stay at court, etc. It seems totally understandable to me, given these circumstances, when someone forgets to silence their cell phone, or takes it out to glance at it, or when someone starts to whisper encouraging things to a child, or to another adult, the two of them trying to figure out, for example, where the judge has disappeared to for the last half hour, or when their loved one will appear, or what the prosecutor is mumbling during the arraignment.\n",

FACE THE JUDGE.” He was 2 feet away from the young woman, and could have used a much different tone to indicate that he understood why she was turning around, but that she had to follow the rules. Instead, he was treating her as if she were already a criminal, and in this moment, was further breaking the law by turning around to glance at her mother. At another point last week, the judge disappeared for about an hour and a half, and during that time, one mother, with two small children and another woman who appeared to be her sister, began to become stressed. She had a limited amount of time she could stay at the courthouse and none of the officers would tell her where the judge went or for how long she would be away. At one point the woman took out her cell phone briefly to check something and spotting her from across the room, a court officer strode towards her, pointing and shouting “PUT THAT AWAY.”\n",

People routinely wait for hours with very little information, and there seems to be a complete lack of empathy for how stressful that experience can be.</p><p>Last week, my shift started at 6:00p; it wasn’t until 7:30p that the judge returned to the courtroom and arraignments resumed, and it was never clear why there was such a long break or when the judge would return (and arraignments only resumed until 8:30p, when an hour long recess was called). During this long period of uncertainty, one of the court officers brusquely told a woman in the audience to put her phone away; this woman commented to her companion that at no point was this rule relayed to her and there were no signs stating this rule in the courtroom. Another woman approached the public defenders’ area multiple times to ask for updates on her son--she was sternly told by an officer not to approach. I have seen this situation play out several times before. <strong>Not only is there a lack of transparency in this process, but when people actively try to seek out information, they are scolded</strong>. Typically, one of the public defenders will then try to help whoever approached. In this case, after the second time this woman asked if her son’s paperwork had been processed, she was told that he was in the other courtroom. She then rushed out of the room, clearly exasperated.</p><p><strong>In addition to the lack of transparency during these waiting periods, the arraignments themselves are difficult to follow</strong>. It is frequently hard to hear what the judge, ADA, and defense are saying, due to a lack of enunciation and amplification. The audience is ordered not to speak during arraignments, yet officers will have conversations with others in the audience, making it that much tougher to hear the proceedings. In addition, the amount of acronyms, law codes, and jargon add to the challenge of parsing what is happening. It is a frustrating experience for me, and I am only there to listen and record--I cannot imagine the stress felt by the defendants and their loved ones (not to mention the added confusion when a language barrier exists).</p><p>For those who work in the justice system, an arraignment is a familiar routine--mundane and uneventful. However, they need to understand the anxiety that comes with waiting for a loved one to be arraigned and how difficult it is for the average citizen to understand the entirety of the proceedings. <strong>There needs to be more transparency in the process, a willingness to share information, and empathy for those who are going through this experience.</strong></p></div>"

       " <p>I have worked three Court Watch shifts so far, and in two of those shifts <strong>I have seen children sent to jail</strong>. The first was a 17-year-old accused of shooting a man in the hip in front of the public housing complex where he lived. The victim didn't pick the child's photo out of a lineup, but the kid was wearing the same color t-shirt as the shooter — red — and the undercover officers who were in the vicinity of the shooting seemed convinced that he had done it, even though he had no prior criminal record.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The second, during my most recent shift last Sunday, was a 16-year-old accused of tucking a firearm with an extended magazine into his waistband. The assistant DA claimed the gun was loaded, but they couldn't say how many bullets were in it. It was unclear to me how the police discovered the weapon in the first place.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Both of these kids were active high-school students</strong>. Both had family members present in court, willing to vouch for their character and do whatever they could to keep their children out of jail. Both, it probably doesn't need to be said, were boys of color. And both had bail set at $2,000 cash, $4,000 bond — very likely more than their families could afford.</p>,\n",
       " <p>About a week after my most recent Court Watch shift, I attended a march protesting the Trump administration's policy of separating families at the border. I chanted, along with thousands of others, \"Donald Trump, we're full of rage! No child in a cage!\" It occurred to me for that all the outrage that has been expressed over the family separation policy in recent weeks, many people don't give much thought to the fact that <strong>America has been putting children in cages since long before Trump was elected, and that we still do, as a regular occurrence, right here in New York City. </strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>The boys I saw arraigned were sent to wait in cages while their parents scrambled to try to make bail. In the best-case scenario, the parents would have been able to pull together $2,000 after a few days, or put themselves at the mercy of a bail bondsman, and their son would have been released to fight the charges from a position of freedom. But even then, the child would have missed at least a few days of school. He would have been separated from his family without knowing when he would be able to see them again. And he would have been subjected to terrifying and degrading conditions that no human being, let alone a teenager, should have to experience. <strong>Even a few nights in jail are potentially enough to traumatize a child for the rest of his life.</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>I think about all the dumb things I did and said when I was 16 and 17, and how lucky I was not to live in a community victimized by overpolicing.<strong> I think about what a scandal it would have been if I or one of my middle-class, white peers had been sent to jail</strong> indefinitely for a crime that we had been accused of based solely on the testimony of an undercover cop. <strong>And I think about how the assistant district attorneys and judges I saw during my Court Watch sessions seemed totally comfortable sending these two children behind bars indefinitely, as though it was just another day at the office.</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Brooklyn Criminal Court <br/>Night Court 6-9pm</em></p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Each time I court watch, I am struck by how the tone set by court police can go a long way in further dehumanizing the accused and their families</strong>. When an arraignment is under way, the main purpose of the present court police seems to be enforcing the rules and decorum of the court room. The rules I see most frequently enforced include no cell phone use, no talking on the benches, and for the accused, no turning around to look at family. These rules may seem simple enough  to follow and enforce, but in my time with court watch, I’ve seen how these simples rules do not account for the needs and understandable instincts of the accused and their families, and can be enforced in unnecessarily aggressive and adversarial ways.</p>,\n",
       " <p>For example, I usually court watch during the night shift, 6-9 PM in Brooklyn, and there are often families sitting on the benches next to me — mothers with young children who wait sometimes hours for their loved ones to appear before the judge. The room is nearly always over-air conditioned and the children get antsy and cold and distracted. Yet, their presence in the room will become crucial when their loved one’s defense points to them during the arraignment and says, “he has ties to the community. In fact, his family is here tonight.” Oftentimes while the adults in the families are waiting for this moment to come, they’re managing a difficult situation — they don’t know when their loved one will appear; the kids get tired and hungry; the stress of not knowing what will happen to the accused is of course enormous (I’ve seen families cry with relief at RORs); perhaps they’ve taken time off of work to attend the arraignment and they’re trying to negotiate how much longer they can stay at court, etc. It seems totally understandable to me, given these circumstances, when someone forgets to silence their cell phone, or takes it out to glance at it, or when someone starts to whisper encouraging things to a child, or to another adult, the two of them trying to figure out, for example, where the judge has disappeared to for the last half hour, or when their loved one will appear, or what the prosecutor is mumbling during the arraignment.</p>,\n",
       " <p>It also seems completely understandable when an accused forgets they’re supposed to be looking at the judge and glances back at their family. Last week, I witnessed a young transgender woman (who was misgendered by the defense, prosecutor and judge) look back with what appeared to be surprise and joy when the defense said “his mother is here in the courtroom to support him.” The young woman had tears in her eyes when she turned around instinctively to look for her mother on the benches.</p>,\n",
       " <p>In both this specific case of the young woman and in many instances of what I described before, when whole families await the arraignment of a loved one, <strong>I have seen court officers meet these small infractions of the court house rules with unneeded aggression</strong>. In the case of the young woman, a court officer immediately barked “TURN AROUND. FACE THE JUDGE.” He was 2 feet away from the young woman, and could have used a much different tone to indicate that he understood why she was turning around, but that she had to follow the rules. Instead, he was treating her as if she were already a criminal, and in this moment, was further breaking the law by turning around to glance at her mother. At another point last week, the judge disappeared for about an hour and a half, and during that time, one mother, with two small children and another woman who appeared to be her sister, began to become stressed. She had a limited amount of time she could stay at the courthouse and none of the officers would tell her where the judge went or for how long she would be away. At one point the woman took out her cell phone briefly to check something and spotting her from across the room, a court officer strode towards her, pointing and shouting “PUT THAT AWAY.” <strong>His demeanor was such that her kid hid his face in her armpit. </strong></p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Court officers encounter people in times of acute stress</strong>. I have seen many of them navigate this reality thoughtfully and compassionately, giving people gentle reminders to put away their cell phones, or taking long moments to explain something to a family member on a bench. I have also seen them yell, use harsh language, and lose their tempers in a matter of seconds. In any case, <strong>their actions and demeanors are crucial to setting the tone of the court room, and it should be imperative that, if they do wield this huge responsibility, they use their authority to reduce the trauma of the situation for all involved, as much as possible.</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Manhattan Criminal Court, AR3<br/>Wednesday June 6, 2018 6-9pm</em></p>,\n",
       " <p>Before volunteering for Court Watch, I would have thought that someone distinguished enough to claim the title of “the people” -  someone with the power to request bail or even jail time - would be competent. But elected New York City prosecutors never fail to underwhelm, and my Court Watch stint during the night of June 6 was a case in point.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Arraignments at Manhattan Criminal Court are difficult to follow - the rapid pace, low volume, and background noise don’t help - but it was easy to spot the prosecutor's disorganization. He charged one of the night’s first defendants with stealing four packages of soap and body wash from a pharmacy. He requested bail (I didn’t catch the amount), but when the public defender and judge balked given the trivial charges, he was unable to provide justification. The judge set a jail alternative.</p>,\n",
       " <p>“The people” then charged a defendant with stealing $1,000 of ice cream from Rite Aid. When the judge and public defender suggested that this was impossible - even, as the judge suggested, with an expensive brand like Haagen-Dazs - the prosecutor just mumbled something about his notes. It seemed clear that the prosecution dreamed up the $1,000 figure since it meets the threshold for grand larceny, a felony, but the prosecutor was again unable to justify bail. Still, the judge set $3,000 bail (if I heard correctly). If the defendant fails to pay - and he likely will not be able to - he will sit in jail until trial.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Sometimes the prosecutor couldn’t find his notes. When they turned up, he dispassionately read them aloud, unable to answer basic questions. While he had a heavy caseload, most arraignments were for relatively trivial crimes - like drugs and shoplifting - and almost all defendants were men of color.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This raises questions about Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance’s ostensibly <a href=\"http://www.cyvanceforda.com/page/criminal-justice-reform\" target=\"_blank\">“progressive” platform</a>. Vance won re-election in November 2017, seeking to “end the criminal prosecution of thousands of low-level, nonviolent offenses annually,” with a focus on communities of color. But his office currently prosecutes so many low level, nonviolent offenses that prosecutors cannot even provide defendants with the dignity of knowing case specifics.</p>,\n",

The defendant found with cocaine had his family in the court room, claiming that they could only put together $5,000 to bail him out, but the Assistant District Attorney demand that it be set at $500,000. The judge, one of the more considerate ones, still set it at $250,000. It doesn’t matter that it was less than the $1 million Weinstein paid, because he would pay the sum, walk free, and get it back when he returned to court. What’s more he had the singular luxury of walking into court with the amount and manner of his bail already decided, rather than fighting it out with the prosecution in court, something I never saw in any of the cases I watched. The man accused of cocaine possession and trafficking, whose whole family was ready to put themselves under financial hardship to pay $5000 bail, will now sit in jail, perhaps for months, or even for 3 years like Kalief Browder. Innocent until proven guilty, but imprisoned nonetheless, he joins the 60-70% of the jail population imprisoned for this crime of poverty. As a society, we’ll pay a college education’s worth of tax dollars every year he stays.\n",

In another case I saw the defense plead for bail not to be set, because the defendant had lost their job while imprisoned on bail the last time they were accused of a crime. Even the stays in prison that are lucky to be short can do this. Another student had exams coming up that they wouldn’t be able to retake until a year later. Their lack of money to pay it meant they’d have to retake their entire year of school. And if poorer defendants do manage to produce bail, one can only imagine what they have to give up to do so, even if only until the date of the trial.\n",

When some people pleaded guilty, they were assigned community service, and were told that they'd have to return to court to prove they'd completed it. So at a minimum, that would likely be two days away from work: 1+ days for the service, and another day to return to court. If they fail to return to court in person, there will be a warrant for their arrest. Given the time it takes on public transit to get to court, and then the time spent waiting, couldn't the city allow them to submit the paperwork online? There seems to be no good reason for this, any more than there has been a reason to force families to physically pay bail at a jail - which often takes many hours to do - rather than online.

Judges most commonly cited the current charge as the reason for setting bail. Defense attorneys most often provided reasoning related to their clients' ties to the community as to why bail should not be set.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bail amounts continue to seem arbitrary.</strong><ul><li>Even under judges that appeared to be ruling favorably towards reasonable bail amounts, there were still cases with minor charges that received high bail amounts. When evaluating judges’ rulings on bail and the type of charges present, clear patterns could still not be found.</li><li>In one case in Brooklyn, the prosecutor requested bail to be set at $30,000 without any substantial reason as to why that specific number was chosen. There was also no indication as to why the final bail amount was eventually set.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Prosecutors do not appear to be knowledgeable on the cases before them.</strong><ul><li>In one specific case, the prosecutor actually stated that she was well prepared for the trial and noted that she possessed a copy of the order of protection that is relevant to the case. However, the public defender disproves this fact and reflects that the prosecutor has the wrong order of protection and is trying to submit to court one that is not even certified.</li><li>Additionally, in several cases, prosecutors are seen reading off scripts while being unable to provide detailed answers to follow-up questions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>High bails are requested for charges with minimal evidence.</strong><ul><li>One watcher witnessed a 17 year-old Black high school student arrested after complaining witness stated that “someone” shot him in the hip.  Student has no priors. Complaining witness could not positively ID the student in a double blind photo array. Police claimed to later witness the student holding a pistol and then fleeing with another individual.   The only identifying information was the color of the shirt the student was wearing and the word of the arresting officer. DA asked for $100,000 bail; judge set bail at $4,000 cash/$6,000 bond.</li></ul></li></ul></div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><h3>Reflections from a Watcher</h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Brooklyn Criminal Court, Room 110<br/>Sunday 10am-1pm</em></p><p>I usually Court Watch on Sundays, and usually in Brooklyn, and <strong>I am beginning to feel familiar with room 110 of the Brooklyn Criminal Court</strong>. For some reason, the most recent time I was there, I felt extra aware of how sounds from outside on the street made their way into the room every once in a while: loud conversations, squealing brakes, a thumping bass played from a car stereo. There were fewer people seated in the audience than I’ve seen in the past, maybe three or four other people were there, sitting on the hard wooden benches.</p><p>During my shift, I was not surprised by much of what I saw. I was frustrated that I did not know, nor know how to obtain, the names of ADAs or of PDs. I could not find that information printed or displayed anywhere. I had to ask the court clerk for the judge’s name, which she patiently spelled out for me. Once proceedings began, <strong>I was frustrated at the speed at which cases moved by</strong>, as I always am. Often, I was barely able to record the docket number and begin taking notes before Judge Yavinsky made his decision. Charges were rarely announced in a clear cut way, nor were they read in an audible register for the audience.</p><p><strong>In cases where the ADA was requesting a large amount of money for bail, the judge would often lower the amount from a ludicrously high number to another, slightly lower, amount</strong>. I wondered what Judge Yavinsky’s intention was when he decreased a bail amount from $50,000 to $20,000.</p><p>As always, <strong>the tone of the room was weirdly casual and dispassionate</strong>, and the gravity of decisions being made—often in 2 minutes or less—between the chatting and laughter of court officers, public defenders, and prosecutors was discomforting.</p></div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><h1 class=\"text-align-center\">MAY 21 - MAY 28</h1><h3>Watchers' Major Takeaways</h3><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li><strong>Most cases wrapped up in under 5 minutes</strong>, with the court spending fewer than 2 minutes on 15% of cases and 2-5 minutes in nearly 40% of cases. In some instances, watchers noted that little time was spent on crucial details.</li><li><strong>Court watchers noted that past criminal history was often mentioned by prosecutors</strong>. Defense attorneys strove to put these past charges into perspective, and to explain why they did not indicate that their client would likely fail to appear for court appearances. A few cases in which this occurred jumped out:<ul dir=\"ltr\"><li>In one case, the accused was charged with a felony (possession of crack cocaine). The ADA noted that the person had a record (felonies, misdemeanors, failure-to-appear) and requested $15,000 bail. The public defender, on the other hand, pointed out that accused’s last felony was in 1991, their most recent misdemeanor was 2 years ago, and their last failure-to-appear was 10 years ago. Given this context, the judge fortunately agreed with the defense attorney, and released the person on their own recognizance.</li><li>In another case, the ADA requested a 90-day sentence or $5,000 bail for a person charged with shoplifting and resisting arrest. The ADA then cited the accused's prior record, but the public defender countered that those incidents took place 32 years ago. Regardless, the judge ultimately set a $5,000 bail.</li><li>A third case in which the ADA’s mention of a past criminal history appeared to lack the appropriate details: the ADA requested $15,000 bail for a person charged with a burglary based on a prior record and failures to appear, the defense successfully argued for ROR, citing that the accused’s prior record was from when he was much younger and that he was now employed full-time.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Prosecutors continued to ask for bail more frequently, and at higher amounts, than judges ultimately decided on</strong>. Bail was set in about 30% of cases observed by court watchers, versus the 50% of cases in which prosecutors asked for the person to be held on bail. The median bail that prosecutors asked for was $15K, versus the $5K median bail decided on by the judge. (Note that this median may not be representative of all cases in the city, and there’s certainly a range of uncertainty given that our watchers sometimes could mishear or misunderstand the decisions).</li><li>As previous posts have noted, the demographics in the courtroom reflect the racially skewed system in which the <strong>vast majority of the accused are people of color (80%)</strong>.</li><li>Many watchers noted this week (and in previous weeks) that it was <strong>hard to hear the judge, ADA, and public defender</strong> in the courtroom. During a watch this week, a few of us talked to the public defender present in the courtroom about this issue. She mentioned that there’s a competing factor: while courts are meant to be open to the public, there is also sensitive information about clients such as health issues or other matters. She personally felt uncomfortable yelling loudly about these things, and sometimes spoke more quietly, wanting to protect her clients’ privacy.</li><li>Watchers in Manhattan observed <strong>the judge set credit card bail</strong> in two instances, which is noteworthy as most watchers have observed bails set only as cash or bond.</li></ul></div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><h3>Reflections from a Watcher</h3><p><strong>When I saw Harvey Weinstein go through arraignment</strong> and get out on bail smoothly with a pre-arranged deal, I couldn’t help but think about the people I watched have very different experiences in the past weeks.</p><p>First was <strong>the use of microphones</strong>. We were lucky if we could hear what was being said most of the time. Imagine having to choose whether to accept a plea deal that could alter your whole life after a few hurried mumbles. Imagine being a family member of the accused and not being able to hear the case being made against your loved one, or even the decision made. In my experience the defense was more interested in using the microphone and making sure the whole courtroom heard, the judges used it some of the time, and the prosecution rarely did.</p><p>Another difference was <strong>the evidence that the prosecution used</strong> to bring Weinstein into court in the first place and how they presented it. In the Weinstein case they said it was the product of months of serious investigation, but didn’t share any details beyond that. They even sealed the order of protection so that it was not known who had accused Weinstein, a luxury I did not see accusers get a single time throughout the 6 hours of arraignments I had watched in the past two weeks.</p><p>Just that Wednesday in the same court building, I saw a man who had been allegedly seen near a car with a bag of cocaine. The prosecution painted him as a serious industrial cocaine trafficker, failing to note that the car and bag both might not be his. After looking over the evidence the judge seemed bewildered. <strong>“Wait” he said, “what grounds did the police have to search him? Did they have a warrant?”</strong> There was a long pause from the prosecution. Finally, they responded that “the police had reasonable grounds to search him.” Later adding that the bag containing the cocaine was clear. It was black. They also painted a picture of him as a serial criminal, failing to note that his last conviction was in 1998.</p><p><strong>Other differences were in the way bail was set</strong> and the way Weinstein simply had the means to walk free that others didn’t. The defendant found with cocaine had his family in the court room, claiming that they could only put together $5,000 to bail him out, but the Assistant District Attorney demand that it be set at $500,000. The judge, one of the more considerate ones, still set it at $250,000. It doesn’t matter that it was less than the $1 million Weinstein paid, because he would pay the sum, walk free, and get it back when he returned to court. What’s more he had the singular luxury of walking into court with the amount and manner of his bail already decided, rather than fighting it out with the prosecution in court, something I never saw in any of the cases I watched. The man accused of cocaine possession and trafficking, whose whole family was ready to put themselves under financial hardship to pay $5000 bail, will now sit in jail, perhaps for months, or even for 3 years like Kalief Browder. Innocent until proven guilty, but imprisoned nonetheless, he joins the 60-70% of the jail population imprisoned for this crime of poverty. As a society, we’ll pay a college education’s worth of tax dollars every year he stays.</p><p><strong>This is a bonus jail sentence reserved for the poor</strong>, and we know from Browder’s case the way that a jail stay for lack of ability to pay bail, before the accused has had the chance of a fair trial, can kill you. In another case I saw the defense plead for bail not to be set, because the defendant had lost their job while imprisoned on bail the last time they were accused of a crime. Even the stays in prison that are lucky to be short can do this. Another student had exams coming up that they wouldn’t be able to retake until a year later. Their lack of money to pay it meant they’d have to retake their entire year of school. And if poorer defendants do manage to produce bail, one can only imagine what they have to give up to do so, even if only until the date of the trial.</p><p>The last difference I noted was<strong> the formality and professionalism in the courtroom.</strong> I guess the cameras do a lot. I saw a defendant told that he needed to stay away from his children after an assault charge on their mother. The evidence though, seemed to lean towards the idea that he was the one assaulted. Either way, his children now had to go without their father for the foreseeable future. The defendant left the court sobbing, but the cops and prosecution laughed amongst each other while watching him. I didn’t see anyone laughing at Weinstein.</p><p><strong>What we saw with Harvey Weinstein was the justice system for the rich</strong>. Don’t think for a second that it’s the justice system most of us will face. The only thing the justice system for the poor and for minorities shares with what we saw on TV was the courtroom.</p></div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><h3>Reflections from a Watcher</h3><p><em>Manhattan Criminal Court, AR2<br/>Monday May 21, 2018</em></p><p>When thinking about ways that the criminal justice system criminalizes poverty, bail often stands out - many thousands of people are in jail (but not yet convicted) in NYC because of the inability to pay bail. But during a recent Manhattan court watch shift, what jumped out at me was that there are also many other ways that the system punishes low-income people. </p><p>I was there with one other volunteer, and we recorded mostly very minor charges for misdemeanors in which people were either released on their own recognizance or pleaded guilty to the charge. When some people pleaded guilty, they were assigned community service, and were told that they'd have to return to court to prove they'd completed it. So at a minimum, that would likely be two days away from work: 1+ days for the service, and another day to return to court. If they fail to return to court in person, there will be a warrant for their arrest. Given the time it takes on public transit to get to court, and then the time spent waiting, couldn't the city allow them to submit the paperwork online? There seems to be no good reason for this, any more than there has been a reason to force families to physically pay bail at a jail - which often takes many hours to do - rather than online. (Even now that there's an <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doc/inmate-info/post-bail.page\" target=\"_blank\">online system</a> in NYC for paying bail, it's not possible to pay most bails online, but only bails under $2.5K that the judge specifically says can be paid that way).</p><p>Another issue came up during the shift when a man pleaded guilty for stealing a couple small items including toothpaste. He was hit with a $200 fine plus surcharge. It goes without saying that someone who resorts to stealing basic necessities like toothpaste is unlikely to have $200+. So what happens next? If he doesn't pay the fine (and doesn't show up to get an extension)- will he then be charged another fine, or even arrested and held in jail? A Brennan Center <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Fees%20and%20Fines%20FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> on court fines across 15 states found that courts rarely consider inability to pay, and that failure to pay can lead to suspension of a driver's license or incarceration (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-43916040/why-does-the-us-still-have-debtors-prisons\" target=\"_blank\">BBC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2014/05/19/312158516/increasing-court-fees-punish-the-poor\" target=\"_blank\">NPR</a> also covered this issue). How many people are cycling through the system because they can't afford court payments? </p></div>,\n",

It is when the charges are read against the accused, pleas are negotiated, and bail is decided. This week, <strong>62% of arraignment hearings watched lasted only 2-5 minutes per case</strong>, 1% were under 2 minutes long, 33% lasted over 5 minutes.<br/> </li><li>During observed bail hearings, when an argument was being made by the prosecutor about why the judge should set bail, <strong>“prior arrests and convictions” was the most common factor mentioned (40% of the time)</strong>. This is despite the fact that in New York, bail is about a person’s ability to return to court, not their previous criminal record. The most common factors mentioned by the defense were “currently employed/in school” (17% of the time) and “ties to the community” (22%).<br/> </li><li><strong>Watchers saw several prosecutors in Manhattan ask the judge to set bail bail on people arrested on drug charges</strong>. In one case, the ADA requested 7,500 and the judge released the young man on supervision. On another, the ADA initially requested $10,000, then increased their request to $20,000, and the judge set $7500. This older Black man was accused of being a lookout while someone else sold drugs.<br/> </li><li>One court watcher observed that the <strong>ADA would verbally accentuate aspects of the complaint that were the most damning and would become very pointed and angry while reading out the details of an incident to the judge</strong>. Other watchers noted how casually ADAs treated aspects of the arraignments that would harm defendants, like bail and orders of protection. One volunteer watched an ADA on the phone while the judge was speaking to the defendant.<br/> </li><li><strong>Often, when prosecutors requested bail, judges assigned people to Supervised Release programs, instead of releasing them on their own recognizance</strong>. Some judges used this as an opportunity to warn accused people that this was their last chance. One said that bail “will absolutely be set” next time if the person did not appear in court.<br/> </li><li><strong>Once again court watchers noticed how much power the court has over families</strong>. One woman was charged with a DUI, and since daughter was in the car when she was arrested, the DA requested a full order of protection with the daughter and $5000 bail. The woman’s family was in court, emotional and upset at the prospect of having the defendant taken to jail and separated from her daughter. The judge allowed her to be released under supervision and to be around her daughter, but prevented her from driving with her daughter. If the prosecutor had their way, they would have been separated for months at the least.</li></ul></div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><h3>Reflections from a Watcher</h3><p><em>Brooklyn Criminal Court</em></p><p>Justice is arbitrary.  During my first two shifts, judges barely participated, usually accepting the DA's recommendation.  At my third shift in Brooklyn, Judge Perlmutter engaged each defendant seeking to understand their circumstances and encouraging alternatives to incarceration.  This encouraged defense attorneys to advocate more forcefully than in my prior shifts where the process was more impersonal.  </p><p>The DAs are still asking for bail in non violent misdemeanor cases.  Asking a homeless man for $10,000 bail when he clearly doesn't have $10 is penal and ignores the available programs that could help the individual.</p><p>The DA is still prosecuting people for smoking weed on the street.</p></div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><h1 class=\"text-align-center\">MARCH 20 - MARCH 27</h1><h3>Watchers' Major Takeaways</h3><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li><strong>As seen previous weeks, exorbitant bails requested by DA are often reduced by the judge.</strong> In over half the cases we observed where the ADA recommended bail, the judge released the defendant on ROR. When the judge did set bail it was less than the amount that the ADA had requested. Some examples seen last week:<ul dir=\"ltr\"><li>$75,000 requested, judge set at $30,000 bond/$15,000 cash: “Audience members reacted audibly to $75,000 bail, court officer said “we don’t need that.”</li><li>$25,000 requested, judge set at $5,000 bond/$2,500 cash (x3)</li><li>$25,000 requested, judge set at $2,000</li><li>$15,000 bail requested by ADA, judge released on ROR</li><li>$10,000 to $5,000 bond/$2,500 cash</li><li>$10,000 requested, judge ROR’d</li><li>$7,500 requested, judge ROR’d</li><li>$7,500 to $3,000 (x2)</li><li>$2,500 requested, judge ROR’d</li></ul></li><li><strong>ADA more likely to recommend bail for black defendants charged of assault</strong>. Over the past month, ADA’s recommended bail for less than half of white defendants charged with assault vs. over 70% for black defendants. Judges set bail in less than a quarter of cases for both groups.</li><li><strong>Language access matters.</strong> In the courtroom, one watcher noted: “The most intimate human relationships are always between the defendant and the interpreter. They are the only people who genuinely are trying to make sure the defendant understands them.”</li><li><strong>Discrepancy of drug arrests based on race.</strong> So far, Court Watch has noted only 11% of defendants arraigned for drug possession were white. In contrast 57% of defendants arrested for drug possession were black. Despite research demonstrating that black and white Americans use drugs at similar rates, based on Court Watch observations, black New Yorkers were eight times more likely to be arraigned for drug possession.</li></ul></div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><h3>Reflections from a Watcher</h3><p><em>Manhattan Criminal Court<br/>DATs Monday March 19, 2018 </em><em>10-1pm</em></p><p>As I sat with my two fellow watchers for my first shift, I couldn't shake my nerves. I was only there to record data, what was I so nervous about?  <strong>But I was acutely aware that little details we were capturing could mean big shifts for the people standing in front of us</strong>. Was I going to see someone ripped away from their family? Was I going to see bail set at an exorbitant rate that the defendant couldn't afford? Was anyone not leaving that courtroom? Thankfully the answer was \"no\". At least for Monday.</p><p><strong>All in all, we saw about 50 DAT's during the shift.</strong> There were a ton of vehicle/traffic violations, and almost all pleaded down to a \"509\" and dismissed. The marijuana cases were all given MACD's, and there was only one instance where bail was requested for a DUI/Assault charge, but the Judge ROR'd the defendant. The defendant had recently been in a coma and was currently on dialysis, with his wife and two brothers in the courtroom.</p><p>I came to Court Watch after spending some time researching community bail funds. Did these exist? Is there a national database? How do I contribute? I had been following a podcast that covered the Kalif Browder story, and after the episode, it sort of broke me. A kid who was accused of stealing a backpack was sent to Rikers after his family could not afford his $3,000 bail. A bail that was set because of a probation violation. And the probation violation stemmed from an incident that he plead guilty to only because he didn't' think he had a defense. So he sat in Rikers for a total of 3 years, 2 years in solitary, because his family couldn't afford bail. How many others are there? <strong>How do we start to unravel the system that has been designed to oppress? How do we bring others into the community so they too begin to see what happens all around them? It starts with a will, and then action, and building community, and demanding change.</strong> I hope this is the beginning of the end of stories like Kalief's.</p></div>,\n",

       "[<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Brooklyn Criminal Court, Room 110<br/>Sunday 10am-1pm</em></p>,\n",
       " <p>I usually Court Watch on Sundays, and usually in Brooklyn, and <strong>I am beginning to feel familiar with room 110 of the Brooklyn Criminal Court</strong>. For some reason, the most recent time I was there, I felt extra aware of how sounds from outside on the street made their way into the room every once in a while: loud conversations, squealing brakes, a thumping bass played from a car stereo. There were fewer people seated in the audience than I’ve seen in the past, maybe three or four other people were there, sitting on the hard wooden benches.</p>,\n",
       " <p>During my shift, I was not surprised by much of what I saw. I was frustrated that I did not know, nor know how to obtain, the names of ADAs or of PDs. I could not find that information printed or displayed anywhere. I had to ask the court clerk for the judge’s name, which she patiently spelled out for me. Once proceedings began, <strong>I was frustrated at the speed at which cases moved by</strong>, as I always am. Often, I was barely able to record the docket number and begin taking notes before Judge Yavinsky made his decision. Charges were rarely announced in a clear cut way, nor were they read in an audible register for the audience.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>In cases where the ADA was requesting a large amount of money for bail, the judge would often lower the amount from a ludicrously high number to another, slightly lower, amount</strong>. I wondered what Judge Yavinsky’s intention was when he decreased a bail amount from $50,000 to $20,000.</p>,\n",
       " <p>As always, <strong>the tone of the room was weirdly casual and dispassionate</strong>, and the gravity of decisions being made—often in 2 minutes or less—between the chatting and laughter of court officers, public defenders, and prosecutors was discomforting.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>When I saw Harvey Weinstein go through arraignment</strong> and get out on bail smoothly with a pre-arranged deal, I couldn’t help but think about the people I watched have very different experiences in the past weeks.</p>,\n",
       " <p>First was <strong>the use of microphones</strong>. We were lucky if we could hear what was being said most of the time. Imagine having to choose whether to accept a plea deal that could alter your whole life after a few hurried mumbles. Imagine being a family member of the accused and not being able to hear the case being made against your loved one, or even the decision made. In my experience the defense was more interested in using the microphone and making sure the whole courtroom heard, the judges used it some of the time, and the prosecution rarely did.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Another difference was <strong>the evidence that the prosecution used</strong> to bring Weinstein into court in the first place and how they presented it. In the Weinstein case they said it was the product of months of serious investigation, but didn’t share any details beyond that. They even sealed the order of protection so that it was not known who had accused Weinstein, a luxury I did not see accusers get a single time throughout the 6 hours of arraignments I had watched in the past two weeks.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Just that Wednesday in the same court building, I saw a man who had been allegedly seen near a car with a bag of cocaine. The prosecution painted him as a serious industrial cocaine trafficker, failing to note that the car and bag both might not be his. After looking over the evidence the judge seemed bewildered. <strong>“Wait” he said, “what grounds did the police have to search him? Did they have a warrant?”</strong> There was a long pause from the prosecution. Finally, they responded that “the police had reasonable grounds to search him.” Later adding that the bag containing the cocaine was clear. It was black. They also painted a picture of him as a serial criminal, failing to note that his last conviction was in 1998.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Other differences were in the way bail was set</strong> and the way Weinstein simply had the means to walk free that others didn’t. The defendant found with cocaine had his family in the court room, claiming that they could only put together $5,000 to bail him out, but the Assistant District Attorney demand that it be set at $500,000. The judge, one of the more considerate ones, still set it at $250,000. It doesn’t matter that it was less than the $1 million Weinstein paid, because he would pay the sum, walk free, and get it back when he returned to court. What’s more he had the singular luxury of walking into court with the amount and manner of his bail already decided, rather than fighting it out with the prosecution in court, something I never saw in any of the cases I watched. The man accused of cocaine possession and trafficking, whose whole family was ready to put themselves under financial hardship to pay $5000 bail, will now sit in jail, perhaps for months, or even for 3 years like Kalief Browder. Innocent until proven guilty, but imprisoned nonetheless, he joins the 60-70% of the jail population imprisoned for this crime of poverty. As a society, we’ll pay a college education’s worth of tax dollars every year he stays.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>This is a bonus jail sentence reserved for the poor</strong>, and we know from Browder’s case the way that a jail stay for lack of ability to pay bail, before the accused has had the chance of a fair trial, can kill you. In another case I saw the defense plead for bail not to be set, because the defendant had lost their job while imprisoned on bail the last time they were accused of a crime. Even the stays in prison that are lucky to be short can do this. Another student had exams coming up that they wouldn’t be able to retake until a year later. Their lack of money to pay it meant they’d have to retake their entire year of school. And if poorer defendants do manage to produce bail, one can only imagine what they have to give up to do so, even if only until the date of the trial.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The last difference I noted was<strong> the formality and professionalism in the courtroom.</strong> I guess the cameras do a lot. I saw a defendant told that he needed to stay away from his children after an assault charge on their mother. The evidence though, seemed to lean towards the idea that he was the one assaulted. Either way, his children now had to go without their father for the foreseeable future. The defendant left the court sobbing, but the cops and prosecution laughed amongst each other while watching him. I didn’t see anyone laughing at Weinstein.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>What we saw with Harvey Weinstein was the justice system for the rich</strong>. Don’t think for a second that it’s the justice system most of us will face. The only thing the justice system for the poor and for minorities shares with what we saw on TV was the courtroom.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Those accused were 89% people of color. The prosecution was 95% White.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The judge stuck with the DA’s recommended sentence 70% of the time.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Failure to Appear was cited as the reason for the DA recommending bail only 16% of the time, but isn’t that the reason to set bail in the first place?</p>,\n",
       " <p>40% of the time, there was no argument even given for requesting bail. 94% of the time, there was no reasoning given by the judge for their bail decision.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Many people said they had trouble finding out the judge’s name or the prosecutor’s name. This week, 44 people were able to record the ADA’s name, while 68 could not. For the month, 95 named the ADA, while 164 could not! <strong>This information should be more transparent to the public.</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Time Crunch</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>As we have seen week after week, the emphasis was on quickly trying as many cases as possible. This week 69% of cases lasted less than 5 minutes. To think that a person’s fate is decided in such a small amount of time is absurd. Watchers noted that there was very little advocacy or argument in the courtroom, instead of going to trial, plea agreements were the norm.</p>,\n",
       " <p>“I saw 60 cases in one 3-hour shift.” - Watcher Amanda Farrell, 5/21, Manhattan AR2, 10am</p>,\n",
       " <p>“Almost all court officials, including the judge, were speaking almost too fast to understand and were mumbling. I can’t imagine what it’s like to have your day in court under these circumstances - where almost no one seems invested in explaining slowly and clearly what is happening to you.” - Nadja E-G, 5/22, Brooklyn, 105</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>What are we policing?</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>Though Cy Vance started an initiative aimed at ending the criminal prosecution of “low-level, non-violent offenses,” last week we saw many cases involving very cheap stolen goods resulting in absurd punishments. <strong>Stealing ice cream and a gift bag resulted in 15 days in jail, 12 bags of shrimp got 5 days, and 2 hairbrushes stolen from Duane Reade and “possession of someone else’s metrocard” got 20 days.</strong> An elderly black man was accused of stealing toothpaste and Preparation H. Can you imagine needing to steal a $6 medicine to relieve your pain - you’re likely already embarrassed - and then a corporate pharmacy presses charges? He was issued a $200 fine, and if he doesn’t pay, he will go to jail. If he can’t afford toothpaste, he likely won’t be able to afford the fine. <strong>In one case, Judge Yavinsky was even quoted as saying, “If you come back with $0, I’m putting you in jail.” He explicitly stated that the defendant’s freedom was dependent on paying money.</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>How much do these sentences cost the taxpayer? Not to mention the judge’s, district attorney’s, and police’s salaries, and every other expense associated with every step of the criminal justice system. One man was arrested for selling popsockets (the thing that sticks to the back of a cell phone) because they weren’t the proper brand and thus were a copyright violation. <strong>Why are we using police and our criminal justice system to enforce copyrights owned by private companies? </strong>It’s fair enough if the company finds him and files a lawsuit, but shouldn’t they go after whichever company is producing the knock-offs and not the guy selling them on the street?</p>,\n",
       " <p>Police are clearly just rounding people up, because what exactly is the social harm being done? <strong>We as a society need to ask ourselves, what are the police for? What is the purpose of our justice system? Who is being protected?</strong> Are our police meant to act as nothing more than hired enforcers for corporations? Should we really be using taxpayer money to round up, arrest, hold, and prosecute poverty? Who does this protect? NONE of these cases addressed a real social harm.</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Manhattan Criminal Court, AR2<br/>Monday May 21, 2018</em></p>,\n",
       " <p>When thinking about ways that the criminal justice system criminalizes poverty, bail often stands out - many thousands of people are in jail (but not yet convicted) in NYC because of the inability to pay bail. But during a recent Manhattan court watch shift, what jumped out at me was that there are also many other ways that the system punishes low-income people. </p>,\n",
       " <p>I was there with one other volunteer, and we recorded mostly very minor charges for misdemeanors in which people were either released on their own recognizance or pleaded guilty to the charge. When some people pleaded guilty, they were assigned community service, and were told that they'd have to return to court to prove they'd completed it. So at a minimum, that would likely be two days away from work: 1+ days for the service, and another day to return to court. If they fail to return to court in person, there will be a warrant for their arrest. Given the time it takes on public transit to get to court, and then the time spent waiting, couldn't the city allow them to submit the paperwork online? There seems to be no good reason for this, any more than there has been a reason to force families to physically pay bail at a jail - which often takes many hours to do - rather than online. (Even now that there's an <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doc/inmate-info/post-bail.page\" target=\"_blank\">online system</a> in NYC for paying bail, it's not possible to pay most bails online, but only bails under $2.5K that the judge specifically says can be paid that way).</p>,\n",
       " <p>Another issue came up during the shift when a man pleaded guilty for stealing a couple small items including toothpaste. He was hit with a $200 fine plus surcharge. It goes without saying that someone who resorts to stealing basic necessities like toothpaste is unlikely to have $200+. So what happens next? If he doesn't pay the fine (and doesn't show up to get an extension)- will he then be charged another fine, or even arrested and held in jail? A Brennan Center <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Fees%20and%20Fines%20FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> on court fines across 15 states found that courts rarely consider inability to pay, and that failure to pay can lead to suspension of a driver's license or incarceration (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-43916040/why-does-the-us-still-have-debtors-prisons\" target=\"_blank\">BBC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2014/05/19/312158516/increasing-court-fees-punish-the-poor\" target=\"_blank\">NPR</a> also covered this issue). How many people are cycling through the system because they can't afford court payments? </p>,\n",
       " <p>**Watchers mark demographics based on what they see and infer, not based on how individuals self-identify.  <br/>**Variation in count results from watchers skipping certain fields on the form.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Of note, <strong>80% of observed defendants were Black and Latinx</strong>, compared to 0% of prosecutors, 8% of public defenders, and 30% of judges.</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Brooklyn Criminal Court</em></p>,\n",
       " <p>Justice is arbitrary.  During my first two shifts, judges barely participated, usually accepting the DA's recommendation.  At my third shift in Brooklyn, Judge Perlmutter engaged each defendant seeking to understand their circumstances and encouraging alternatives to incarceration.  This encouraged defense attorneys to advocate more forcefully than in my prior shifts where the process was more impersonal.  </p>,\n",
       " <p>The DAs are still asking for bail in non violent misdemeanor cases.  Asking a homeless man for $10,000 bail when he clearly doesn't have $10 is penal and ignores the available programs that could help the individual.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The DA is still prosecuting people for smoking weed on the street.</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Manhattan Criminal Court<br/>DATs Monday March 19, 2018 </em><em>10-1pm</em></p>,\n",
       " <p>As I sat with my two fellow watchers for my first shift, I couldn't shake my nerves. I was only there to record data, what was I so nervous about?  <strong>But I was acutely aware that little details we were capturing could mean big shifts for the people standing in front of us</strong>. Was I going to see someone ripped away from their family? Was I going to see bail set at an exorbitant rate that the defendant couldn't afford? Was anyone not leaving that courtroom? Thankfully the answer was \"no\". At least for Monday.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>All in all, we saw about 50 DAT's during the shift.</strong> There were a ton of vehicle/traffic violations, and almost all pleaded down to a \"509\" and dismissed. The marijuana cases were all given MACD's, and there was only one instance where bail was requested for a DUI/Assault charge, but the Judge ROR'd the defendant. The defendant had recently been in a coma and was currently on dialysis, with his wife and two brothers in the courtroom.</p>,\n",
       " <p>I came to Court Watch after spending some time researching community bail funds. Did these exist? Is there a national database? How do I contribute? I had been following a podcast that covered the Kalif Browder story, and after the episode, it sort of broke me. A kid who was accused of stealing a backpack was sent to Rikers after his family could not afford his $3,000 bail. A bail that was set because of a probation violation. And the probation violation stemmed from an incident that he plead guilty to only because he didn't' think he had a defense. So he sat in Rikers for a total of 3 years, 2 years in solitary, because his family couldn't afford bail. How many others are there? <strong>How do we start to unravel the system that has been designed to oppress? How do we bring others into the community so they too begin to see what happens all around them? It starts with a will, and then action, and building community, and demanding change.</strong> I hope this is the beginning of the end of stories like Kalief's.</p>,\n",

Specific instances that Court Watchers observed include:<ul><li>DA asked for <strong>$15,000 and judge sets at $2,500</strong>.</li><li>DA requested <strong>$7,500</strong> for drug possession and speeding ticket and judge set bail at <strong>$2,500</strong>.</li><li>Another <strong>$10,000 reduced to $4,500</strong>.</li><li>Another at <strong>$10,000 reduced to $2,500</strong>.</li><li>Requested <strong>$3,000 and judge granted ROR</strong>.</li><li>Another from <strong>$5,000</strong> (for a defendant with spinal meningitis, recovering from paralysis and living in a shelter--sold heroin to undercover officer) to <strong>ROR</strong>.</li><li>In another case, the DA requests <strong>$35,000 </strong>cash bail for drug sale and possession,and the judge set bail at <strong>$5,000</strong> for white man who has a medical surgery coming up.</li><li>From <strong>$30,000 to $1,500</strong>.</li><li>From <strong>$15,000 to $3,000</strong>.</li><li>The judge reduces bond from <strong>$10,000 to $2,500</strong> for facilitating drug sale - defendant struggles with addiction and mental health.</li><li>The judge reduces a bond from <strong>$7,500 to $2,500</strong> for a collision into traffic light.<br/> </li></ul></li><li>Overall, over this last week, in <strong>40% of observed cases </strong>where the ADA requested bail, the judge granted ROR, and in <strong>85% of observed cases</strong> where the judge did set bail, the bail was set lower than what the ADA had requested. Community ties often seem to impact judge’s decision on bail.<br/> </li><li><strong>The behavior of certain ADAs towards defendants is dehumanizing</strong>. In a system that is already cold, in which defendants have often spent the prior night alone in the precinct, some ADAs refuse to make eye contact with defendants, often seem bored, and misquote defendants.<br/> </li><li><strong>ADA’s often refer to alleged violence and the nature of the crime during the bail hearing</strong>. In one case, ADA seemed to allege a defendant was violent even though there’s “nothing on the books.” Also stated that defendant would “throw his child on the tracks,” when defendant’s wife says this statement is false.<br/> </li><li><strong>Police officers appear disrespectful during arraignments</strong>. NYPD officers talked to each other throughout the proceedings although no one else is allowed to speak in the arraignment rooms. In one instance, a cop grabbed a defendant for jumping up from bench too fast. A watcher observed officers “goofing around, pushing each other, laughing throughout the morning. It seemed incongruous with the proceedings.”<br/> </li><li><strong>Orders of protection are issued even when the person supposedly being protected requests that no order be issued</strong>. In one instance, the public defender requested a limited Order of Protection because the defendant’s girlfriend, who shares two children with the defendant, did not want want it. The judge refused and ordered a full order of protection.<br/> </li><li><strong>Does the sentence fit the “crime”?</strong> Watchers observed a heartbreaking case of an older black person with a medical condition sentenced to 20 days in jail for stealing 3 containers of olive oil. Another defendant was given 20 days in jail for stealing yogurt from a Duane Reade.<br/> </li><li><strong>Innocent until proven guilty? More like guilty until proven innocent.</strong> One watcher noted, “It seems like the public defense has to do more digging and homework into each case, and each person’s personal stories in order to help them; prosecutors don’t seem to have to do much extra work. It’s like a whole system against the defendant. Like the defendant is fighting an army.”</li></ul></div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><h3>Reflections from a Watcher</h3><p><em>Brooklyn Criminal Court<br/>AR1 Tuesday March 20, 2018 </em><em>10-1pm</em></p><p><strong>The fact that the cost of living in New York City is unattainable for many of its citizen is news to no one</strong>. While residents of this city with incomes that allow any amount of comfort may often discuss this fact with dismay, what is less often discussed are the crimes of poverty this economic landscape inevitably produces. When the <a href=\"http://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/36061\" target=\"_blank\">living wage in this city</a> is $16.14 and the minimum wage is $10.40, people will inevitably steal things like food and clothing. The moral binaries we have drawn with the criminal justice system renders theft a black and white issue, even when it is a crime of poverty. <strong>My experience watching arraignments for petty larceny shined a light on the absurdity of this paradigm, and its tragic result: entrenching the already poor in ever deeper poverty.</strong>  </p><p>The punishment often set for petty larceny cases is 1-5 days of community service, and is sometimes jail time. This form of theft is clearly a crime of poverty - cases I and other watchers saw in Brooklyn and Manhattan courts included theft of undergarments from a Family Dollar and a yogurt from a Duane Reade. <strong>The individual who took a guilty plea for stealing yogurt received a sentence of 20 days in jail.</strong> The other defendant was sentenced to 3 days of community service. While one sentence is obviously more inhumane than the other, both ignore the issue at the heart of the offenses, and in doing so fail to further the supposed goals of our criminal justice system. In both situations, a defendant who clearly committed a crime in order to access a basic necessity is removed from the workforce by the criminal justice system. Through ripping away days potentially spent earning money, the system only shoves these citizens deeper into the cycle of poverty that likely drove them to steal food and clothing. <strong>The criminal justice system as I saw it in action appears to operate in the service of maintaining income inequality rather than reducing crime.</strong></p></div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><h1 class=\"text-align-center\">MARCH 06 - MARCH 13</h1><h3>Reflections from a Watcher</h3><p><em>Manhattan Criminal Court<br/>AR1 Friday March 02, 2018 </em><em>6-1:30am </em><br/><em>AR1&amp;2 Friday March 09, 2018 6-1:30am</em></p><p>It’s hard not to watch arraignments in Manhattan criminal court without thinking about the differences between the “progressive” practices of Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance vs. Philadelphia District Attorney Lee Krasner.  This week Krasner released a memo instructing his line DA’s on the do’s and don’ts of his office’s new anti-incarceration practices. <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/373860422/Finalized-Memo-Mar-13-2018\">Krasner’s memo begins</a>:</p><ol><li><strong>Do not charge possession of marijuana (cannabis) regardless of weight.</strong></li><li><strong>Do not charge any of the offenses relating to paraphernalia or buying from a person (BFP) where the drug involved is marijuana.</strong></li><li><strong>Do not charge prostitution cases against sex workers where a person who has been arrested has, two, one or no prostitution convictions.  Withdraw all pending cases in these categories that would be declined for charging under this policy. </strong></li></ol><p>Here in NYC, people are still being arrested on decades-old open warrants, as well as prosecuted for prostitution, low-level marijuana possession, turnstile jumping, and misdemeanors related to their mental health diagnosis or addiction. Vance has declared through much public fanfare that he is no longer prosecuting these <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2018/02/01/manhattan-da-will-no-longer-prosecute-turnstile-jumping-229568\">violations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/manhattan-and-brooklyn-das-stop-asking-bail-most-misdemeanor-cases/\">misdemeanors</a>, and that <a href=\"https://www.manhattanda.org/district-attorney-vance-dismisses-240000-summons-cases/\">warrants older than 10 years have been vacated</a>.</p><p>However, there is an entire class of people who are still criminalized and prosecuted with these charges because they have had prior encounters with law enforcement and are labeled by NYC DAs and the NYPD in the COMPSTAT/ Domain Alert Awareness List as people: “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/magazine/cyrus-vance-jrs-moneyball-approach-to-crime.html\">whose incapacitation by the criminal-justice system would a have positive impact on the community’s safety”.</a>  <strong>Who is on this list? </strong> Vance himself tells us: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/magazine/cyrus-vance-jrs-moneyball-approach-to-crime.html\">“…the list also includes active gang members, people whom the D.A. considers “uncooperative witnesses,” and a fluctuating number of violent “priority targets…”</a></p><p>Similarly, Vance was celebrated in January for <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/01/09/manhattan-brooklyn-das-are-ending-bail-for-non-felonies/\" target=\"_blank\">ending bail for non-felonies</a>, however the <a href=\"https://www.manhattanda.org/manhattan-and-brooklyn-district-attorneys-offices-end-requests-bail-most-misdemeanor/\" target=\"_blank\">exceptions to this policy</a> mean that his ADA’s continue to request bail for low-level misdemeanors, as the Court Watch NYC twitter (@CourtWatchNYC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CourtWatchNYC\" target=\"_blank\">continues to highlight</a>.</p><p>This was all abundantly clear to me during the two arraignment shifts I watched in Manhattan last week. <strong>Here is what I saw.</strong></p><p><strong>People are still being prosecuted and sent to Rikers for low-level misdemeanor drug possession.</strong><br/>The evening of March 9th, a black man in his mid-20s came through Manhattan arraignments having been arrested for allegedly possessing an empty pipe with residue (a violation charge) and resisting arrest (misdemeanor charge). He had been searched at a subway station while in transit and there was no field test done on the pipe – which, as the public defender pointed out, made it impossible to prove whether the pipe was used to smoke a controlled substance. The man had missed court the day before, however it was the day of the thunder snowstorm and the presiding judge reasonably did not issue a warrant. Regardless, <strong>ADA Samantha Rayborn requested $1500 bail on the drug charge and Judge Clynes agreed to set bail</strong>. The man’s next court date is not until March 19th, which means that he will be jailed on Rikers Island for 10 days unless someone can afford his bail, which did not appear to be the case.</p><p><strong>People on parole, probation, or with previous criminal records seem to be more likely to be arrested, prosecuted, have bail set, and found guilty.</strong><br/>On March 9th, a man in his 30’s was arrested by the NYPD the same morning he was discharged from Federal prison (he was in Federal prison in the first place for a parole violation). The alleged crime – stealing three motor scooters (grand larceny in the third) – happened ten months earlier. His mother was in court and wailed: “<em>This was meant to be his homecoming day--</em>” as she sat patiently watching the arraignments all night paying VERY close attention to the fact that everyone else accused of grand larceny was released on their own recognizance.</p><p>Instead of her son being ROR’d too, as the others were, the ADA asked for 15k bail; Judge Watters gave him $7500.  His mother bemoaned the fact that he had been locked up again simply because of his prior record. <em>“I don’t understand—everyone else accused of Grand Larceny was ROR’d : why not my son?   I don’t have anyone else and I don’t have the money,”</em><strong> </strong>she cried as she shuffled-off down the hallway with her head down.</p><p><strong>People are still being arrested for low-level prostitution charges.</strong><br/><a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2017/02/03/sex_trafficking_nypd_tips.php\">The NYPD says it is no longer arresting ppl on prostitution charges</a> but one mother from Midtown was arrested on Criminal Prostitution in the 4th degree (promoting prostitution/pimping) for renting a room in her apartment to another woman who brought an undercover over. She was arraigned on March 2nd in Manhattan criminal court and the line ADA asked for $1500 bail. The public defender argued that she had two young children and this was her first arrest. She was ROR’d .</p><p><strong>People are still being arrested for old warrants.</strong><br/>In one case on March 2nd, a man with a warrant from 1987 was brought into Judge Weston’s court. The Line ADA insisted the warrant was still valid but Judge Weston’ couldn’t find it in the system.  The judge released the gentleman to the protests of the Manhattan DA’s office, even though <a href=\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/07/26/district-attorneys-old-warrants/\" target=\"_blank\">their office allegedly forgave all warrants older than ten years</a>. It seems that these warrants were not expunged for everyone.</p></div>,\n",
       " <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><h1 class=\"text-align-center\">FEBRUARY 27 - MARCH 06</h1><h3>Watchers' Major Takeaways</h3><ul><li><strong>Family and community presence in court matters.</strong> In Brooklyn court this week, when the ADA recommended $20,000 bail for a defendant, the judge reduced it to $5,000 cash/$10,000 bond because his family came to court, including cousins, mother, girlfriend, and son. Even if community ties did not ultimately convince the judge to release the person without bail, it did seem to influence the reduction of the bail amount.<ul><li><strong>What does this mean for people who do not have family or friends that can show up in court for them?</strong> Showing up in court means taking a day off work or school. It means needing to find child care or transportation money to get to the court house. And our most marginalized community members -- folks experiencing homelessness, mental illness, or drug addiction -- don't always have the support networks to show up in the first place. Does that mean they deserve to have bail set and go to Rikers Island?<br/> </li></ul></li><li><strong>The arrest to arraignment process is not only traumatizing, but also humiliating and dehumanizing.</strong> In one case, an individual was arrested while wearing pajamas and slippers and forced to go before the judge this way. They were given a $5,000 cash bail.<br/> </li><li><strong>While supposedly open to the public, it can be difficult to hear the court proceedings in arraignments</strong>. Our watchers experienced microphone issues from Judge Claudia Daniels-DePeyster’s microphone in Manhattan court. During the day the microphone went on and off. Later when an officer in the courtroom was asked about it, he claimed the microphone was working well and was on the entire day. Eventually, with enough direct pressure from a Court Watcher, the judge started speaking into the microphone for the rest of the shift. <br/> </li><li><strong>Orders of protection, intended to protect individuals that have been harmed, can often cause destabilizing rippling effects for families and communities.</strong> Judge Alonso in Manhattan issued an order of protection for a mother with no previous record who is the sole provider of her son. The order of protection involved two people she did not know but who are associated with her son's school; the order of protection prevents her from being near them. Her son has physical and mental health issues and is severely bullied. He relies on her to walk him to school each morning, but with the order of protection, it is unclear how he will get to school.<br/> </li><li><strong>There seemed to be very little empathy for defendants in visible emotional or physical distress. </strong>One judge was heard saying \" the defendant needs to be in a hospital room not a courtroom\" and yet the case continued on. In one case, a defendant was clearly confused about what was happening, but no one was concerned with answering their questions or clarifying the process. </li></ul></div>,\n",

       " <![endif]--><!--StartFragment-->I have many thoughts and emotions about the two shifts I have completed for Court Watch NYC in Manhattan. <strong>It is a dehumanizing and outright financial bloodletting on the poorest members of our community.</strong> The Court in Manhattan is very close to Wall Street, where oligarchs and mostly white men of privileged background make their fortune. That is in sharp contrast to the largely people of color population being brought before judges in arraignment court.</p><p>I saw 38 cases in two shifts. 37 of those cases were people of color. The majority of the cases were marijuana possession cases. <strong>Is it a coincidence that every marijuana case was a person of color? Do white college students refrain from smoking weed in NYC?</strong> It is sobering to look at systemic racism right in the face.</p><p>The amount of money being raised off the poorest in our city is appalling as well. The ADA in one case was asking for bail because a defendant had not paid all the court costs associated with a 5 year old ACD. <strong>The old saying that poverty is violence never seemed more true.</strong></p><p>We are taught in school about our noble justice system. That’s not what I saw. I people dehumanized by prosecutors who viewed them as numbers in a game of conviction rates. <strong>I truly hope shining a light on this process will spur public awareness and reform.</strong></p><p><!--EndFragment--></p></div>,\n",

Judges often cited that as part of their consideration when deciding bail.<ul><li>A Brooklyn ADA requested $15,000 bail for someone charged with driving under the influence who had a history of license suspension and failures to appear. The judge released the accused with a suspended license and order for assessment, stating: <strong>“Because your mother cared enough to show up and shows you have strong community ties.”</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Orders of protection were requested or issued even when alleged victims did not want one</strong> or where the order of protection would <strong>endanger the accused’s employment or housing</strong>.<ul><li>One ADA requested a full order of protection that <strong>would have made the accused (and their child) homeless</strong>. The public defender requested a limited order, which the judge granted.</li><li>A new apartment security worker tried to prevent a group of kids, who were residents of the building, from entering. A physical altercation followed with no resulting injuries but the security worker was arrested. The ADA requested $7,500 bail, but the judge chose to release, still issuing three orders of protection. <strong>The public defender noted that compliance would be nearly impossible since the accused works where the protected people live.</strong> The judge responded, “That’s the accused’s problem.” <strong>It is very likely that the security worker will now lose his job.</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Judges and DAs seemed to be consistent when handling cases that involved traffic charges.</strong> For DUI, people were released with a suspended license. On non-DUI charges, people paid a fine or agreed to community service, and were then able to walk out.</li></ul></div>,\n",

Court Watch NYC gave me an opportunity to see how the court prosecutes individuals that commit crimes.</p><p>My court watch experience left me baffled. I was puzzled and perturbed with the judge and district attorney prosecuting decisions. <strong>There's clearly ample discrepancy in the justice system.</strong></p><p>The number one thing that caught my attention was the <strong>cloud of inhumanity in the courtroom</strong>. I genuinely believe you shouldn’t judge someone without having concrete evidence or granular sources. As a judge, you should look at all the factors that surround the actions of human beings. <strong>The judges would set high bails on individuals who were not financially stable or those who had physical or mental disabilities</strong>. I also noticed that the <strong>judge wouldn't even look at the accused person </strong>when the district attorney was presenting the charges or when they gave their sentence.</p><p><strong>I hope things change</strong>. The judge and DA's must remember that we're all human beings trying to live.</p></div>,\n",

Different judges seemed to show different levels of patience with non-English speakers. How does this impact judges' decisions and outcomes for defendants?</li><li>Very few defendants had family with them in court. One Watcher noted that only 2 of 12 cases had family present. <strong>Having family there in the court room seemed to make a difference</strong> in whether someone was released or had bail set.</li><li><strong>Bail is set higher and more frequently on domestic violence and sexual assault cases, </strong>even when the alleged \"victim\" was in the court room and did not want to press charges.</li><li><strong>Housing status impacted the outcome of several cases</strong>. One defendant was denied from a supervised release program at Brooklyn Justice Initiatives because he was homeless and could not provide a stable point of contact.</li><li>Several public defenders mentioned their <strong>clients had trouble accessing the medication and other mental health services they needed</strong>.

       " <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><h3>Reflections from a Watcher</h3><p><em>Manhattan Criminal Court, AR3<br/>Wednesday January 29, 2018 6-9pm</em></p><p>From my personal perspective as an immigrant from Germany, my first court watch shift was very interesting. Before the shift, I was somewhat nervous. <strong>I had never been to an American courtroom before and wasn't familiar with the \"protocol\".</strong> Could I just walk in? How many fellow court watch volunteers were going to show up? How were we going to be perceived? And, most importantly, what were we going to witness in the courtroom?</p><p>Upon entering the Manhattan criminal court building, <strong>I immediately felt my white privilege</strong>. There was no line and the security officers were friendly and clearly did not perceive me as a potential threat. Even though the metal detector made a sound, they didn't make much of an effort to search me. </p><p>The four other Watchers and I sat together and helped each other out whenever we missed a docket number or couldn't hear what the the judge, ADA, or public defender were saying. We were surprised by the amount of time in between arraignments (which also helped us fill the gaps in our forms) and by just how many people are working in the courtroom. The atmosphere among the officers and clerks seemed lighthearted, which was striking, given the content of what we were all witnessing.</p><p>We were very visible for multiple reasons. First of all, there was not much of an audience and we stood out because we were a group, we were taking notes, and four of the five of us were white. This matters because <strong>10 of the 12 defendants we saw were black and so were most of the family members</strong> who came to court support their loved ones. With the exception of two black women,<strong> almost all defendants were male</strong>.</p><p>With few exceptions, the Assistant District Attorney (ADA) requested bail in almost every single case and as far as I remember, the amount was always at least $1000. <strong>It was interesting to me that setting bail seems to be the default.</strong> The ADA’s stated reasons for the bail requests were usually the defendants' criminal records, but there seemed to be no consideration to the types of crimes committed in the past (e.g. nonviolent vs. violent) and whether the last time they got into trouble was 6 months or 20 years ago. <strong>People who had committed a felony in the past were the least likely to be released and people whose family members showed up to court were the most likely to be released</strong>. In one Driving Under the Influence case, the judge specifically mentioned the defendant's mother's presence in the courtroom as a reason for the release.</p><p>Another thing that stood out was that <strong>the amount of bail seemed arbitrary and sometimes extreme</strong>. The case that stuck with me the most was that of an older black woman (maybe in her 50s), who was accused of a burglary. Because she had a history of burglaries, the ADA requested $30k bail. Her public defender explained that this woman lived in a shelter, suffered from diabetes, and regularly went to Housing Works for assistance and services. It was obvious that poverty was a huge factor here and that she would have gone to jail even if the bail had been $200. At the end, the judge went with $25k bail, which left me puzzled.</p><p>Generally speaking, I was surprised by one judge, Laurie Peterson, because I had expected the judge to go with the ADA's recommendation the majority of the time. <strong>Instead, this judge went against the ADA's recommendations and released multiple defendants</strong>. I also noticed that she took time to carefully explain the conditions of the release to the defendants, especially when they were young. She asked questions and in some cases, she spoke directly to the defendants.</p><p>My most recurring thought as of late has been that poverty in NYC (and the US as a whole) is very <em>expensive</em>.</p></div>,\n",

       "[<p><em>Brooklyn Criminal Court<br/>AR1 Tuesday March 20, 2018 </em><em>10-1pm</em></p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>The fact that the cost of living in New York City is unattainable for many of its citizen is news to no one</strong>. While residents of this city with incomes that allow any amount of comfort may often discuss this fact with dismay, what is less often discussed are the crimes of poverty this economic landscape inevitably produces. When the <a href=\"http://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/36061\" target=\"_blank\">living wage in this city</a> is $16.14 and the minimum wage is $10.40, people will inevitably steal things like food and clothing. The moral binaries we have drawn with the criminal justice system renders theft a black and white issue, even when it is a crime of poverty. <strong>My experience watching arraignments for petty larceny shined a light on the absurdity of this paradigm, and its tragic result: entrenching the already poor in ever deeper poverty.</strong>  </p>,\n",
       " <p>The punishment often set for petty larceny cases is 1-5 days of community service, and is sometimes jail time. This form of theft is clearly a crime of poverty - cases I and other watchers saw in Brooklyn and Manhattan courts included theft of undergarments from a Family Dollar and a yogurt from a Duane Reade. <strong>The individual who took a guilty plea for stealing yogurt received a sentence of 20 days in jail.</strong> The other defendant was sentenced to 3 days of community service. While one sentence is obviously more inhumane than the other, both ignore the issue at the heart of the offenses, and in doing so fail to further the supposed goals of our criminal justice system. In both situations, a defendant who clearly committed a crime in order to access a basic necessity is removed from the workforce by the criminal justice system. Through ripping away days potentially spent earning money, the system only shoves these citizens deeper into the cycle of poverty that likely drove them to steal food and clothing. <strong>The criminal justice system as I saw it in action appears to operate in the service of maintaining income inequality rather than reducing crime.</strong></p>,\n",

       " <p>It’s hard not to watch arraignments in Manhattan criminal court without thinking about the differences between the “progressive” practices of Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance vs. Philadelphia District Attorney Lee Krasner.  This week Krasner released a memo instructing his line DA’s on the do’s and don’ts of his office’s new anti-incarceration practices. <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/373860422/Finalized-Memo-Mar-13-2018\">Krasner’s memo begins</a>:</p>,\n",
       " <p>Here in NYC, people are still being arrested on decades-old open warrants, as well as prosecuted for prostitution, low-level marijuana possession, turnstile jumping, and misdemeanors related to their mental health diagnosis or addiction. Vance has declared through much public fanfare that he is no longer prosecuting these <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2018/02/01/manhattan-da-will-no-longer-prosecute-turnstile-jumping-229568\">violations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/manhattan-and-brooklyn-das-stop-asking-bail-most-misdemeanor-cases/\">misdemeanors</a>, and that <a href=\"https://www.manhattanda.org/district-attorney-vance-dismisses-240000-summons-cases/\">warrants older than 10 years have been vacated</a>.</p>,\n",
       " <p>However, there is an entire class of people who are still criminalized and prosecuted with these charges because they have had prior encounters with law enforcement and are labeled by NYC DAs and the NYPD in the COMPSTAT/ Domain Alert Awareness List as people: “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/magazine/cyrus-vance-jrs-moneyball-approach-to-crime.html\">whose incapacitation by the criminal-justice system would a have positive impact on the community’s safety”.</a>  <strong>Who is on this list? </strong> Vance himself tells us: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/magazine/cyrus-vance-jrs-moneyball-approach-to-crime.html\">“…the list also includes active gang members, people whom the D.A. considers “uncooperative witnesses,” and a fluctuating number of violent “priority targets…”</a></p>,\n",
       " <p>Similarly, Vance was celebrated in January for <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/01/09/manhattan-brooklyn-das-are-ending-bail-for-non-felonies/\" target=\"_blank\">ending bail for non-felonies</a>, however the <a href=\"https://www.manhattanda.org/manhattan-and-brooklyn-district-attorneys-offices-end-requests-bail-most-misdemeanor/\" target=\"_blank\">exceptions to this policy</a> mean that his ADA’s continue to request bail for low-level misdemeanors, as the Court Watch NYC twitter (@CourtWatchNYC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CourtWatchNYC\" target=\"_blank\">continues to highlight</a>.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This was all abundantly clear to me during the two arraignment shifts I watched in Manhattan last week. <strong>Here is what I saw.</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>People are still being prosecuted and sent to Rikers for low-level misdemeanor drug possession.</strong><br/>The evening of March 9th, a black man in his mid-20s came through Manhattan arraignments having been arrested for allegedly possessing an empty pipe with residue (a violation charge) and resisting arrest (misdemeanor charge). He had been searched at a subway station while in transit and there was no field test done on the pipe – which, as the public defender pointed out, made it impossible to prove whether the pipe was used to smoke a controlled substance. The man had missed court the day before, however it was the day of the thunder snowstorm and the presiding judge reasonably did not issue a warrant. Regardless, <strong>ADA Samantha Rayborn requested $1500 bail on the drug charge and Judge Clynes agreed to set bail</strong>. The man’s next court date is not until March 19th, which means that he will be jailed on Rikers Island for 10 days unless someone can afford his bail, which did not appear to be the case.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>People on parole, probation, or with previous criminal records seem to be more likely to be arrested, prosecuted, have bail set, and found guilty.</strong><br/>On March 9th, a man in his 30’s was arrested by the NYPD the same morning he was discharged from Federal prison (he was in Federal prison in the first place for a parole violation). The alleged crime – stealing three motor scooters (grand larceny in the third) – happened ten months earlier. His mother was in court and wailed: “<em>This was meant to be his homecoming day--</em>” as she sat patiently watching the arraignments all night paying VERY close attention to the fact that everyone else accused of grand larceny was released on their own recognizance.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Instead of her son being ROR’d too, as the others were, the ADA asked for 15k bail; Judge Watters gave him $7500.  His mother bemoaned the fact that he had been locked up again simply because of his prior record. <em>“I don’t understand—everyone else accused of Grand Larceny was ROR’d : why not my son?   I don’t have anyone else and I don’t have the money,”</em><strong> </strong>she cried as she shuffled-off down the hallway with her head down.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>People are still being arrested for low-level prostitution charges.</strong><br/><a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2017/02/03/sex_trafficking_nypd_tips.php\">The NYPD says it is no longer arresting ppl on prostitution charges</a> but one mother from Midtown was arrested on Criminal Prostitution in the 4th degree (promoting prostitution/pimping) for renting a room in her apartment to another woman who brought an undercover over. She was arraigned on March 2nd in Manhattan criminal court and the line ADA asked for $1500 bail. The public defender argued that she had two young children and this was her first arrest. She was ROR’d .</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>People are still being arrested for old warrants.</strong><br/>In one case on March 2nd, a man with a warrant from 1987 was brought into Judge Weston’s court. The Line ADA insisted the warrant was still valid but Judge Weston’ couldn’t find it in the system.  The judge released the gentleman to the protests of the Manhattan DA’s office, even though <a href=\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/07/26/district-attorneys-old-warrants/\" target=\"_blank\">their office allegedly forgave all warrants older than ten years</a>. It seems that these warrants were not expunged for everyone.</p>,\n",

       " <![endif]--><!--StartFragment-->I have many thoughts and emotions about the two shifts I have completed for Court Watch NYC in Manhattan. <strong>It is a dehumanizing and outright financial bloodletting on the poorest members of our community.</strong> The Court in Manhattan is very close to Wall Street, where oligarchs and mostly white men of privileged background make their fortune. That is in sharp contrast to the largely people of color population being brought before judges in arraignment court.</p>,\n",
       " <p>I saw 38 cases in two shifts. 37 of those cases were people of color. The majority of the cases were marijuana possession cases. <strong>Is it a coincidence that every marijuana case was a person of color? Do white college students refrain from smoking weed in NYC?</strong> It is sobering to look at systemic racism right in the face.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The amount of money being raised off the poorest in our city is appalling as well. The ADA in one case was asking for bail because a defendant had not paid all the court costs associated with a 5 year old ACD. <strong>The old saying that poverty is violence never seemed more true.</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>We are taught in school about our noble justice system. That’s not what I saw. I people dehumanized by prosecutors who viewed them as numbers in a game of conviction rates. <strong>I truly hope shining a light on this process will spur public awareness and reform.</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p><!--EndFragment--></p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Brooklyn Criminal Court, AR3<br/>Monday February 5, 2018 6-9pm</em></p>,\n",
       " <p>As an African American man, I was curious to learn more about the justice system. <strong>With the injustice that is happening in this world, I want to make a positive impact on my community and bring a brighter future for tomorrow</strong>. Court Watch NYC gave me an opportunity to see how the court prosecutes individuals that commit crimes.</p>,\n",
       " <p>My court watch experience left me baffled. I was puzzled and perturbed with the judge and district attorney prosecuting decisions. <strong>There's clearly ample discrepancy in the justice system.</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>The number one thing that caught my attention was the <strong>cloud of inhumanity in the courtroom</strong>. I genuinely believe you shouldn’t judge someone without having concrete evidence or granular sources. As a judge, you should look at all the factors that surround the actions of human beings. <strong>The judges would set high bails on individuals who were not financially stable or those who had physical or mental disabilities</strong>. I also noticed that the <strong>judge wouldn't even look at the accused person </strong>when the district attorney was presenting the charges or when they gave their sentence.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>I hope things change</strong>. The judge and DA's must remember that we're all human beings trying to live.</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Manhattan Criminal Court, AR3<br/>Wednesday January 29, 2018 6-9pm</em></p>,\n",
       " <p>From my personal perspective as an immigrant from Germany, my first court watch shift was very interesting. Before the shift, I was somewhat nervous. <strong>I had never been to an American courtroom before and wasn't familiar with the \"protocol\".</strong> Could I just walk in? How many fellow court watch volunteers were going to show up? How were we going to be perceived? And, most importantly, what were we going to witness in the courtroom?</p>,\n",
       " <p>Upon entering the Manhattan criminal court building, <strong>I immediately felt my white privilege</strong>. There was no line and the security officers were friendly and clearly did not perceive me as a potential threat. Even though the metal detector made a sound, they didn't make much of an effort to search me. </p>,\n",
       " <p>The four other Watchers and I sat together and helped each other out whenever we missed a docket number or couldn't hear what the the judge, ADA, or public defender were saying. We were surprised by the amount of time in between arraignments (which also helped us fill the gaps in our forms) and by just how many people are working in the courtroom. The atmosphere among the officers and clerks seemed lighthearted, which was striking, given the content of what we were all witnessing.</p>,\n",
       " <p>We were very visible for multiple reasons. First of all, there was not much of an audience and we stood out because we were a group, we were taking notes, and four of the five of us were white. This matters because <strong>10 of the 12 defendants we saw were black and so were most of the family members</strong> who came to court support their loved ones. With the exception of two black women,<strong> almost all defendants were male</strong>.</p>,\n",
       " <p>With few exceptions, the Assistant District Attorney (ADA) requested bail in almost every single case and as far as I remember, the amount was always at least $1000. <strong>It was interesting to me that setting bail seems to be the default.</strong> The ADA’s stated reasons for the bail requests were usually the defendants' criminal records, but there seemed to be no consideration to the types of crimes committed in the past (e.g. nonviolent vs. violent) and whether the last time they got into trouble was 6 months or 20 years ago. <strong>People who had committed a felony in the past were the least likely to be released and people whose family members showed up to court were the most likely to be released</strong>. In one Driving Under the Influence case, the judge specifically mentioned the defendant's mother's presence in the courtroom as a reason for the release.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Another thing that stood out was that <strong>the amount of bail seemed arbitrary and sometimes extreme</strong>. The case that stuck with me the most was that of an older black woman (maybe in her 50s), who was accused of a burglary. Because she had a history of burglaries, the ADA requested $30k bail. Her public defender explained that this woman lived in a shelter, suffered from diabetes, and regularly went to Housing Works for assistance and services. It was obvious that poverty was a huge factor here and that she would have gone to jail even if the bail had been $200. At the end, the judge went with $25k bail, which left me puzzled.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Generally speaking, I was surprised by one judge, Laurie Peterson, because I had expected the judge to go with the ADA's recommendation the majority of the time. <strong>Instead, this judge went against the ADA's recommendations and released multiple defendants</strong>. I also noticed that she took time to carefully explain the conditions of the release to the defendants, especially when they were young. She asked questions and in some cases, she spoke directly to the defendants.</p>,\n",
       " <p>My most recurring thought as of late has been that poverty in NYC (and the US as a whole) is very <em>expensive</em>.</p>,\n",

    "done it, even though he had no prior criminal record. The second, during my most recent shift last Sunday, was a \n",
    "16-year-old accused of tucking a firearm with an extended magazine into his waistband. The assistant DA claimed the \n",
    "gun was loaded, but they couldn't say how many bullets were in it. It was unclear to me how the police discovered the \n",
    "weapon in the first place. Both of these kids were active high-school students. Both had family members present in \n",
    "court, willing to vouch for their character and do whatever they could to keep their children out of jail. Both, \n",
    "it probably doesn't need to be said, were boys of color. And both had bail set at $2,000 cash, $4,000 bond — very \n",
    "likely more than their families could afford. About a week after my most recent Court Watch shift, I attended a march\n",
    "protesting the Trump administration's policy of separating families at the border. I chanted, along with thousands of \n",
    "others, \"Donald Trump, we're full of rage! No child in a cage!\" It occurred to me for that all the outrage that has \n",

    "after a few days, or put themselves at the mercy of a bail bondsman, and their son would have been released to fight \n",
    "the charges from a position of freedom. But even then, the child would have missed at least a few days of school. He \n",
    "would have been separated from his family without knowing when he would be able to see them again. And he would have \n",

    "present court police seems to be enforcing the rules and decorum of the court room. The rules I see most frequently \n",
    "enforced include no cell phone use, no talking on the benches, and for the accused, no turning around to look at family.\n",

    "For example, I usually court watch during the night shift, 6-9 PM in Brooklyn, and there are often families sitting on\n",
    "the benches next to me — mothers with young children who wait sometimes hours for their loved ones to appear before \n",
    "the judge. The room is nearly always over-air conditioned and the children get antsy and cold and distracted. Yet, \n",
    "their presence in the room will become crucial when their loved one’s defense points to them during the arraignment \n",
    "and says, “he has ties to the community. In fact, his family is here tonight.” Oftentimes while the adults in the \n",
    "families are waiting for this moment to come, they’re managing a difficult situation — they don’t know when their \n",
    "loved one will appear; the kids get tired and hungry ; the stress of not knowing what will happen to the accused is \n",
    "of course enormous (I’ve seen families cry with relief at RORs); perhaps they’ve taken time off of work to attend the \n",
    "arraignment and they’re trying to negotiate how much longer they can stay at court, etc. It seems totally understandable\n",
    "to me, given these circumstances, when someone forgets to silence their cell phone, or takes it out to glance at it, \n",
    "or when someone starts to whisper encouraging things to a child, or to another adult, the two of them trying to figure \n",
    "out, for example, where the judge has disappeared to for the last half hour, or when their loved one will appear, or \n",
    "what the prosecutor is mumbling during the arraignment. It also seems completely understandable when an accused \n",
    "forgets they’re supposed to be looking at the judge and glances back at their family. Last week, I witnessed a young \n",
    "transgender woman (who was misgendered by the defense, prosecutor and judge) look back with what appeared to be \n",
    "surprise and joy when the defense said “his mother is here in the courtroom to support him.” The young woman had tears\n",

    "one, I have seen court officers meet these small infractions of the court house rules with unneeded aggression. \n",
    "In the case of the young woman, a court officer immediately barked “TURN AROUND. FACE THE JUDGE.” He was 2 feet away \n",
    "from the young woman, and could have used a much different tone to indicate that he understood why she was turning \n",
    "around, but that she had to follow the rules. Instead, he was treating her as if she were already a criminal, and in \n",
    "this moment, was further breaking the law by turning around to glance at her mother. At another point last week, the \n",
    "judge disappeared for about an hour and a half, and during that time, one mother, with two small children and another \n",
    "woman who appeared to be her sister, began to become stressed. She had a limited amount of time she could stay at the \n",

    "navigate this reality thoughtfully and compassionately, giving people gentle reminders to put away their cell phones, \n",
    "or taking long moments to explain something to a family member on a bench. I have also seen them yell, use harsh \n",

    "New York City prosecutors never fail to underwhelm, and my Court Watch stint during the night of June 6 was a \n",
    "case in point. Arraignments at Manhattan Criminal Court are difficult to follow - the rapid pace, low volume, and \n",
    "background noise don’t help - but it was easy to spot the prosecutor's disorganization. He charged one of the night’s \n",

    "the amount), but when the public defender and judge balked given the trivial charges, he was unable to provide \n",

    "ice cream from Rite Aid. When the judge and public defender suggested that this was impossible - even, as the judge \n",
    "suggested, with an expensive brand like Haagen-Dazs - the prosecutor just mumbled something about his notes. It seemed\n",
    "clear that the prosecution dreamed up the $1,000 figure since it meets the threshold for grand larceny, a felony, but \n",
    "the prosecutor was again unable to justify bail. Still, the judge set $3,000 bail (if I heard correctly). If the \n",
    "defendant fails to pay - and he likely will not be able to - he will sit in jail until trial. Sometimes the \n",
    "prosecutor couldn’t find his notes. When they turned up, he dispassionately read them aloud, unable to answer basic \n",
    "questions. While he had a heavy caseload, most arraignments were for relatively trivial crimes - like drugs and \n",

    "and prosecutors was discomforting. When I saw Harvey Weinstein go through arraignment and get out on bail smoothly \n",
    "with a pre-arranged deal, I couldn’t help but think about the people I watched have very different experiences in the \n",
    "past weeks. First was the use of microphones</strong>. We were lucky if we could hear what was being said most of the \n",
    "time. Imagine having to choose whether to accept a plea deal that could alter your whole life after a few hurried \n",
    "mumbles. Imagine being a family member of the accused and not being able to hear the case being made against your \n",
    "loved one, or even the decision made. In my experience the defense was more interested in using the microphone and \n",
    "making sure the whole courtroom heard, the judges used it some of the time, and the prosecution rarely did. Another \n",
    "difference was <strong>the evidence that the prosecution used</strong> to bring Weinstein into court in the first \n",
    "place and how they presented it. In the Weinstein case they said it was the product of months of serious investigation,\n",
    "but didn’t share any details beyond that. They even sealed the order of protection so that it was not known who had \n",
    "accused Weinstein, a luxury I did not see accusers get a single time throughout the 6 hours of arraignments I had \n",
    "watched in the past two weeks. Just that Wednesday in the same court building, I saw a man who had been allegedly \n",
    "seen near a car with a bag of cocaine. The prosecution painted him as a serious industrial cocaine trafficker, failing\n",
    "to note that the car and bag both might not be his. After looking over the evidence the judge seemed bewildered. \n",
    "“Wait” he said, “what grounds did the police have to search him? Did they have a warrant?” There was a long pause \n",
    "from the prosecution. Finally, they responded that “the police had reasonable grounds to search him.” Later adding\n",
    "that the bag containing the cocaine was clear. It was black. They also painted a picture of him as a serial criminal, \n",
    "failing to note that his last conviction was in 1998. Other differences were in the way bail was set and the way \n",
    "Weinstein simply had the means to walk free that others didn’t. The defendant found with cocaine had his family in the\n",
    "court room, claiming that they could only put together $5,000 to bail him out, but the Assistant District Attorney \n",
    "demand that it be set at $500,000. The judge, one of the more considerate ones, still set it at $250,000. It doesn’t \n",
    "matter that it was less than the $1 million Weinstein paid, because he would pay the sum, walk free, and get it back \n",
    "when he returned to court. What’s more he had the singular luxury of walking into court with the amount and manner of \n",
    "his bail already decided, rather than fighting it out with the prosecution in court, something I never saw in any of \n",
    "the cases I watched. The man accused of cocaine possession and trafficking, whose whole family was ready to put \n",
    "themselves under financial hardship to pay $5000 bail, will now sit in jail, perhaps for months, or even for 3 years \n",
    "like Kalief Browder. Innocent until proven guilty, but imprisoned nonetheless, he joins the 60-70% of the jail \n",
    "population imprisoned for this crime of poverty . As a society, we’ll pay a college education’s worth of tax dollars \n",
    "every year he stays. This is a bonus jail sentence reserved for the poor</strong>, and we know from Browder’s case the\n",
    "way that a jail stay for lack of ability to pay bail, before the accused has had the chance of a fair trial, can kill \n",
    "you. In another case I saw the defense plead for bail not to be set, because the defendant had lost their job while \n",
    "imprisoned on bail the last time they were accused of a crime. Even the stays in prison that are lucky to be short can \n",
    "do this. Another student had exams coming up that they wouldn’t be able to retake until a year later. Their lack of \n",
    "money to pay it meant they’d have to retake their entire year of school. And if poorer defendants do manage to produce\n",
    "bail, one can only imagine what they have to give up to do so, even if only until the date of the trial. The last \n",
    "difference I noted was the formality and professionalism in the courtroom. I guess the cameras do a lot. I saw a \n",
    "defendant told that he needed to stay away from his children after an assault charge on their mother. The evidence \n",
    "though, seemed to lean towards the idea that he was the one assaulted. Either way, his children now had to go without\n",
    "their father for the foreseeable future. The defendant left the court sobbing, but the cops and prosecution laughed\n",
    "amongst each other while watching him. I didn’t see anyone laughing at Weinstein. What we saw with Harvey Weinstein \n",

    "The amount of money being raised off the poorest in our city is appalling as well. The ADA in one case was asking \n",
    "for bail because a defendant had not paid all the court costs associated with a 5 year old ACD. The old saying that \n",
    "poverty is violence never seemed more true. We are taught in school about our noble justice system. That’s not what \n",

    "The number one thing that caught my attention was the cloud of inhumanity in the courtroom. \n",
    "I genuinely believe you shouldn’t judge someone without having concrete evidence or granular sources. \n",
    "As a judge, you should look at all the factors that surround the actions of human beings. The judges would set \n",

    "matters because 10 of the 12 defendants we saw were black and so were most of the family members who came to court \n",
    "support their loved ones. With the exception of two black women, almost all defendants were male. \n",
    "With few exceptions, the Assistant District Attorney (ADA) requested bail in almost every single case and as far as \n",
    "I remember, the amount was always at least $1000. It was interesting to me that setting bail seems to be the \n",
    "default. The ADA’s stated reasons for the bail requests were usually the defendants' criminal records, \n",
    "but there seemed to be no consideration to the types of crimes committed in the past (e.g. nonviolent vs. violent) \n",
    "and whether the last time they got into trouble was 6 months or 20 years ago. <strong>People who had committed a \n",
    "felony in the past were the least likely to be released and people whose family members showed up to court were the \n",

    "ADA requested $30k bail. Her public defender explained that this woman lived in a shelter, suffered from diabetes, and\n",
    "regularly went to Housing Works for assistance and services. It was obvious that poverty was a huge factor here and \n",
    "that she would have gone to jail even if the bail had been $200. At the end, the judge went with $25k bail, which left \n",
    "me puzzled. Generally speaking, I was surprised by one judge, Laurie Peterson, because I had expected the judge to go\n",
    "with the ADA's recommendation the majority of the time. <strong>Instead, this judge went against the ADA's \n",
    "recommendations and released multiple defendants</strong>. I also noticed that she took time to carefully explain \n",
    "the conditions of the release to the defendants, especially when they were young. She asked questions and in some \n",
